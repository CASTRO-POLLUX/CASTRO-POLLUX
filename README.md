- 👋 Hi, I’m @CASTRO-POLLUX
- 👀 I’m interested in coding I dabeled a little bit in high school but I'm trying to learn something new. I'm a quick learner so I figured why not put my myself into something that'll benefit me in the long run. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the professional parts of running a business, I usually was the employee so I'm now trying to learn things from the other side per say.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate, I don't know what to put on this part lol I'm new to this, with someone/people, in the higher profession, who has patience and is willing to show and teach someone who is just wanting to learn something or everything 
- 📫 How to reach me, castro.pollux.twins@gmail.com
I'd really like to learn how to write code, or learn cyber security or anything that'll get me to an Intermediate or even a Professional Level
